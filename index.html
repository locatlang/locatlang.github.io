				<h1>So this is a programming language</h1>
				<p>
					Creating programming languages because of some complaining about Javascript is perfectly normal, right?<br>
					Yeah so we made one. It compiles into Javascript (the compiled code probably looks horrible) and it's similar to Java. It does have dynamic typing but it's a bad practice. Yeah.
